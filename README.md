### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Strahinja!

Altough I don't drink :coffee: often and I'm not crazy about the :new_moon: theme,\
I still feel like a proper software developer. ðŸš€

Welcome to my creative corner! :seedling:

This is where I turn my ideas into code, make mistakes and improve.\
But most importantly, I share it all with you. :roller_coaster:

- I'm currently working on my own Bidding App (stay tuned). 

Fun facts:
- I'm a car enthusiast
- I love snow
- I like to work in the morning
- I enjoy melted chocolate

 :mailbox_with_mail:
 I just wanted to say a big thank you to everyone who inspired me or taught me something!
